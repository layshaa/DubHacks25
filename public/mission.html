                        When we first started, we weren't entirely sure what direction we wanted to take.
                        We knew we wanted our project to make an impact, to help people and break down barriers.
                        That's when the idea for Platy came about, an AI-powered platform designed to simplify and
                        translate complex legal literature.
                        <br><br>
                        Our goal was to make legal knowledge more accessible to everyone, especially high school students,
                        immigrants, individuals involved in the justice system, the elderly, and those with limited
                        education. These are the communities that often face the greatest challenges in understanding
                        legal information, and we believe everyone deserves the chance to understand their rights.
